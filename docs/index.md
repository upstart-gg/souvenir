features:
  - title: Automatic Memory Tools
    details: Just add tools to your agent. It automatically stores important info and retrieves relevant memories when needed.

  - title: Knowledge Graphs from Research
    details: Built on academic research (arXiv:2505.24478). Captures entities and relationships, not just text similarity.

  - title: Smart Retrieval Strategies
    details: Vector search, graph traversal, or hybrid - the agent picks the best strategy for each query.

  - title: Simple Setup
    details: Create instance → Get tools → Add to agent. That's it. The agent handles everything else automatically.

  - title: Multi-User Sessions
    details: Each user gets their own memory space. Memories don't leak between users.

  - title: PostgreSQL + pgvector
    details: Production-ready storage with fast vector similarity search and graph traversal.

  - title: Research-Proven Results
    details: Knowledge graphs improve multi-hop reasoning by 30%, complex queries by 25% vs. vector-only systems.

  - title: Built for Vercel AI SDK
    details: Designed specifically for Vercel AI SDK agents with TypeScript support and proper tool schemas.
